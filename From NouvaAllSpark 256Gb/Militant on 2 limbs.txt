Am a  militant on 2 limbs
Middle fingers on 2 trigs
Fury on a red beams
Look me do a blue twist
Shuffling fast on my bush nigs
Dark knight on a rude limps
stepping fast 2 limbs ( lightnings)
aint a rapper so you fired
(Says the dark knight on 2 shift)

Am the Maswan on the quantum
not only one time
Arch my bow till u wonder
Drive u down till you wonder
Missles spining you wonder
Hidden in Uganda
Wipe my shoes you bastard
Cold chills you bastard
Chills down your back you bastard
 
Deep in Uganda

Turn the ocassion to a barrutti
You called me to a rap science
Turn the weather to a full wind
Guesse there had to be some violence

A rap storm is brewing
Drop the rythme upset the balance
Bring the noise coz its amusing 
I need to feel some powers
