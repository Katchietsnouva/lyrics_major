Ride wit me like this  
When I see a pretty face like u  
I pull up quick, no time to waste, girl hop in, let's do what we do  
Slide through the city, windows down, vibe on high, just me and you  
You got that glow, that fire in your eyes, make a nigga forget the crew  
Pretty face, thick waist, you the type that turn heads in the street  
But you ride for me, loyal to the core, ain't no switchin' on the team  
We dodge the ops, keep it lowkey, but your smile light up the scene  
In this drill life, you my peace, girl, you know what I mean  
Ride wit me like this, through the storm or the shine  
Pretty face like u, got me locked in, you mine  
We spin the block, chase the bag, leave the haters behind  
Ride wit me like this, baby, one of a kind  
Now we posted up, sippin' lean, watchin' stars in the night  
You bad as hell, pretty face got me feelin' right  
But if they try us, Drac' in the back, we ready to fight  
Ride wit me like this, hold it down through the flight  
Your touch like fire, burnin' up the spot  
Pretty face like u, girl, you all I got  
In this drill game, we stay hot, never get caught  
Ride wit me like this, forever or not.










[Verse 1]  
Hop in the whip, we skrrt through the ends  
Rae by my side, no fake friends  
Pretty face glowin' under street lights  
We dodge the feds, keep it tight all night  
You got that vibe, make the drama fade  
In this drill life, we upgrade  
From the block to the top, no cap  
Your smile hits harder than a trap  

[Chorus]  
It's ride with Rae like this  
When I see a pretty face like you  
I pull up quick, no hesitation, boo  
We slide through the city, just us two  
It's ride with Rae like this  
Heart racin', feelin' that bliss  
Pretty face, you my fix  
In the storm, we persist  

[Verse 2]  
Late nights, schemin' on the next move  
You hold it down, got nothin' to prove  
Enemies lurkin', but we stay strapped  
Your loyalty real, never turn back  
Pretty eyes sparklin' like diamonds in the rough  
In this cold world, your love's enough  
We chase the bag, leave the past in dust  
Ride or die, in you I trust  

[Chorus]  
It's ride with Rae like this  
When I see a pretty face like you  
I pull up quick, no hesitation, boo  
We slide through the city, just us two  
It's ride with Rae like this  
Heart racin', feelin' that bliss  
Pretty face, you my fix  
In the storm, we persist  

[Bridge]  
Yo, when the ops come knockin', we ghost  
You my queen, I toast to the most  
No pretty face can compare to yours  
We build empires, open doors  

[Verse 3]  
Sunrise hits, we still on the grind  
Your touch electric, blow my mind  
From the trenches to the penthouse view  
Pretty face, it's all 'cause of you  
We laugh at the haters, they fade away  
In this game, we play to stay  
Ride with Rae, forever engraved  
Our story's epic, never caged  

[Chorus]  
It's ride with Rae like this  
When I see a pretty face like you  
I pull up quick, no hesitation, boo  
We slide through the city, just us two  
It's ride with Rae like this  
Heart racin', feelin' that bliss  
Pretty face, you my fix  
In the storm, we persist  

[Outro]  
Yeah, ride with Rae like this...  
Pretty face, you the one I miss...  
We out.
