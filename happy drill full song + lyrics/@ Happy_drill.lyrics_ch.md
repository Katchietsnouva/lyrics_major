Got it — I’ll keep it **drill**, clean, and original.

Here’s a continuation that fits the cadence:

```
ride wit rae like this  
when I see a pretty face like you  
heart go freeze, no glitch  
but my mind still stay on the move  

late nights, city lit  
dark roads, we ain’t got no curfew  
came up from the mud real quick  
now the vision too clear, no blur view  

silent steps, heavy plans  
trust few, I don’t talk too loose  
they be watching my every move  
but I’m focused, I don’t lose  

ride wit rae like this  
no fear when the pressure due  
from the block to the big stage lights  
yeah, the dream still coming true
```

If you want:

* more **UK drill slang**
* a **catchier hook**
* or to match a **specific BPM / artist vibe**

say the word and I’ll refine it.












Aight, sticking **strictly** to that rhyme pocket 👇
**this / and / you**

```
ride wit rae like this  
never switch, I stand on truth  
ten toes down, I don’t miss  
every move yeah it’s for you  

talk too slick, get dismissed  
I been quiet, making moves  
they don’t know how cold this is  
when the vision’s locked on you  

from the ends to the lists  
same grind, different view  
they be asking how I did this  
I just stayed real, stayed true  

no pretend, no assist  
I don’t fold, I break through  
every loss got me like this  
still I rise, still it’s you
```

If you want it:

* **more aggressive drill**
* **melodic drill**
* or **short punchy bar-style**

tell me the vibe and tempo, bro.



















Bet — locking it **exactly** to that line and rhyme pocket.

```
ride with rage like this  
pain stitched in what I do  
heart cold, still I risk  
every step yeah it’s you  

mind tense, clenched fist  
been through hell, made it through  
they don’t get why I’m like this  
had to grow, had no clue  

late nights made me this  
no handouts, just the truth  
if I fall I still persist  
get back up, think of you  

ride with rage like this  
no love lost, still move  
world hard, yeah it’s twisted  
but I aim straight, straight at you
```

If you want it **darker**, **faster**, or more **UK drill coded**, say the word and I’ll tune it.
























Alright — I’ll lock it in and build a **full drill song** with **verses (stanzas)** and a **clean, catchy chorus**, keeping your exact hook lines and rhyme pocket.

### **CHORUS**

```
its ride with rage like this  
wen i see a pretty face like you  
heart cold but it still don’t miss  
every mad thought slow for you  

its ride with rage like this  
dark nights but the vision true  
world loud, mind stay silent  
still I move how I do, for you
```

---

### **VERSE 1**

```
grew up fast, no assist  
had to learn what pain can do  
fake love, yeah I missed  
now I read through every move  

street talks, politics  
every smile got a clue  
had to turn my heart to bricks  
just to make it out the blues  

late train, no ticket  
still I ride with nothing to lose  
momma prayin’, God listen  
now the pressure feelin’ new
```

---

### **CHORUS**

```
its ride with rage like this  
wen i see a pretty face like you  
heart cold but it still don’t miss  
every mad thought slow for you  

its ride with rage like this  
dark nights but the vision true  
world loud, mind stay silent  
still I move how I do, for you
```

---

### **VERSE 2**

```
trust low, circle thin  
I been walkin’ with a few  
every loss cut my skin  
but it sharpened my view  

they don’t know what I did  
just to stand where I’m due  
turned the pressure into wins  
now they asking “who’s you?”  

same road, new whip  
same hunger, different food  
still I ride with the rage in me  
but I calm it when it’s you
```

---

### **BRIDGE**

```
if the lights all fade  
and the world turn blue  
would you stay when it’s rainin’  
not just love me when it’s new?
```

---

### **FINAL CHORUS**

```
its ride with rage like this  
wen i see a pretty face like you  
heart cold but it still don’t miss  
every mad thought slow for you  

its ride with rage like this  
from the ends to a better view  
still scarred but I’m focused  
yeah I ride, yeah I move — for you
```

If you want:

* **UK drill slang**
* **melodic drill hook**
* **faster BPM / darker energy**
