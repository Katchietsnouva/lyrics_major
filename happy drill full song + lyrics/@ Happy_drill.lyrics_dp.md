**Title: Ride With Rage**

**(Verse 1)**
The engine’s a beast with a murderous sound
A rumble in the concrete, shakin’ the ground
Got a heart full of nitro and a head full of night
Punch the clock, disappearin’ in the neon light
I’m chasin’ a feeling, a forgetful high
Beneath a bruised and a purple sky
The white lines are blurrin’, a hypnotic spell
I’m runnin’ from heaven and I’m fl irtin’ with hell

**(Chorus)**
**Its ride with rage like this  
When I see a pretty face like you  
A sudden shift, a twist of fate  
Nothin’ that I wouldn’t do  
Its ride with rage like this  
You hit my world, a spark, a crash  
A beautiful, beautiful disaster flash  
When I see a pretty face like you.**

**(Verse 2)**
You were standin’ there cool, like a dangerous dream
In a halo of streetlight with a rebellious gleam
Didn’t say a word, just a look you gave
Told me you were trouble, and I’m your willing slave
You just nodded sideways to the open door
A silent promise for the pain in store
I knew right then, past the point of no return
For the way you smile, watch my whole world burn

**(Chorus)**
**Its ride with rage like this  
When I see a pretty face like you  
A sudden shift, a twist of fate  
Nothin’ that I wouldn’t do  
Its ride with rage like this  
You hit my world, a spark, a crash  
A beautiful, beautiful disaster flash  
When I see a pretty face like you.**

**(Bridge)**
Is it love or is it the speed?
This addictive, terminal need…
The tarmac screams, the city flies
The truth is hiding in your eyes
We might not make it through the bend…
But I’d do it all again.

**(Guitar Solo – frantic, melodic, full of urgency)**

**(Chorus)**
**Its ride with rage like this  
When I see a pretty face like you  
A sudden shift, a twist of fate  
Nothin’ that I wouldn’t do  
Its ride with rage like this  
You hit my world, a spark, a crash  
A beautiful, beautiful disaster flash  
When I see a pretty face like you.**

**(Outro)**
Yeah, a pretty face like you…
Just a pretty face like you…
Ride with rage…
Fadin’ into the blue…
