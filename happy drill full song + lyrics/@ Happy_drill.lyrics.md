ride or rage,
ride or rage,
and a pretty face 

pretty face,
pretty face 
in a spark and  age

spark and age
spark and age
in a pretty face

pretty face
am a star, 
so i ride or rage
# its a ride

 
 
Hop onto my whip, 
skrrt {through} the ends my side is  you,
# skrrt through the ends with you,
slide fast through the city,
create a scene, A scene for just us two,
dodge the feds like pimp, 
keep it tight all night wit you, 
It's ride with Rage like this
am a star, 
so i can ride a range



Is it 
the love or the love of speed,
or speed of love with you? 
# or the speed of love when am with you? 
In the storm, even i  persist
persist my love  all  i got's  you

ride or rage like this  
never switch, I stand on truth  
ten toes down  i dont miss  
every move yeah it’s for you  




am addicted to the tarmac
na hiyo tarmnac iko addicted to me

This addictive especeially the tarmac
The tarmac screams, 

the city flies


You got that vibe, make the drama fade
In this drill life, we upgrade
From the block to the top, no cap
Your smile hits harder than a trap





never turn back


or the love of speed when i speed the love with you?

A sudden shift, a twist of fate
Nothin’ that I wouldn’t do
Its ride with rage like this
You hit my world, a spark, a crash
A beautiful, beautiful crash 
When I see a pretty face like you.
