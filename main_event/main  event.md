**Pre intro**:
From the streets to the main event, Blueprints in my head
Living my dreams, where I pay no rent, sleeping walking on gems
From the pavement to stage, (where) real ones connect 
From the camera that is lit by the ships (where) legends get set

**Verse 1**:
So One day 
Gonna wake up so blessed (yeàh)
And 
suffer so much from success (success)
And 
Some pure witness in my side eye (Side eye)
And
pulled a mad dive with a high price (high price)
And 

**Verse 2**:
So One day 
Gonna wake up so rich (yeàh)
And
Make an Intro into the main event (yeàh)
And
Stackin’ paper, yeah, the money pile (money pile)
And
See the world in a different dial (different dial)
And


**Chorus**:
Bro, am lit, sub 9
Pull-up with a freak, coz shez mine 
Like a bumble bee, best fit, no lie
Flipping flows like a coin flip, oh my.....
Rush the software, to the next mix, by midnight 
Slide from this to the next pik, my my (ex)
Look at me, max out the breeze, with might 
hope you see, signs of prestige, Will I?

Print like from a cartridge, my life
If it's this I gonna dive, my guys 
Think I got traffic lights?, gonna try
Loose this can't be paralysed?, mad bite

Pull up like a ghost friek, oo my
Set loose like a dynamite, my bike
So wide like an Atlantic night, wheres bride
Met her on a dance night 
So I rush the mix


Epic like a Pyramid, in a quick spy
So dense like Spotify, Shazam mine

jet high 

Never mind the blast guy, my knight 


**Verse 3**:
So One day 
Gonna wake up so blessed (yeàh)
And
Switch a clean side with a fit style (Fit style)
And
Draped in the shine, can’t you dim my light (my light)
And
Got my eyes on the prize, vision’s tight (tight)
So

**Verse 4**:
So One day 
Gonna wake up so rich (yeàh)
And
Make an Intro into the main event (yeàh)
And
I play my cards, no fear, no fright (no fright)
And
Built from the ground up, watch me take flight (take flight)


**Chorus**:
Bro, am lit, sub 9
Pull-up with a freak, coz shez mine 
Like a bumble bee, best fit, no lie
Flipping flows like a coin flip, oh my.....
Rush the software, to the next mix, by midnight 
Slide from this to the next pik, my my (ex)
Look at me, max out the breeze, with might 
hope you see, signs of prestige, Will I?

Print like from a cartridge, my life
If it's this I gonna dive, my guys 
Think I got traffic lights?, gonna try
Loose this can't be paralysed?, mad bite
Set loose like a dynamite, my bike
So wide like an Atlantic night, wheres bride
Met her on a dance night 
So I rush the mix


Epic like a Pyramid, in a quick spy
So dense like Spotify, Shazam mine

jet high 

Never mind the blast guy, my knight 



**Verse 5**:
So One day 
Gonna wake up so blessed (yeàh)
And
Rockin’ brands that’ll make you smile (you smile)
And
Flexin’ moves with a laid-back smile (smile)
And
I’m takin’ over, mile by mile (mile by mile)

**Verse 6**:
So One day 
Gonna wake up so rich (yeàh)
And
Make an Intro into main event (yeàh)
And
From the streets to the top, coz this is my trial (my trial)
And 
From the streets, then I make my jog to the main event

**Chorus**:
Bro, am lit, sub 9
Pull-up with a freak, coz shez mine 
Like a bumble bee, best fit, no lie
Flipping flows like a coin flip, oh my.....
Rush the software, to the next mix, by midnight

So I rush the mix












I get your point, and yes — I could have just said no. But it wasn’t about the 500 shillings. It was about the principle and what that request represented in that moment. I wanted to highlight something deeper, not to shame or embarrass you, but to express how men sometimes feel when such expectations are made without any awareness of how it might come across.

You’re right, it was my choice to give or not give. But sometimes, people use that “you could’ve said no” line to avoid acknowledging that the request itself carried an emotional weight. For men, it’s rarely about the amount — it’s about the feeling of being valued only when we’re needed for something material. And I think that’s what I was reacting to, even if it came out in a way that sounded like a “sideshow.”

Maybe it wasn’t the smoothest way to express it, but it came from a real place. Because constantly being put in that position — where giving is expected but feelings aren’t considered — can get exhausting. It’s not about saying no; it’s about being seen beyond what we can provide.

So if my tone rubbed you the wrong way, I’ll own that. But the message behind it still stands. I wanted you to understand why it hit differently, not to make it about the money, but about the meaning behind it.
