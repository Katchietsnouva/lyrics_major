Look at the art of my limbs
The art of my limbs
Burning out Filling up my design like a sword from a sheath
Burning from a sheath
Burning out to be the best out of the best industry

The sad Look from my mother 
Destroyed Glory of my father
I must bring my target up from the home of crustacean


Why you joking with me
Why you joking with me




Look at the rhymes of my lines 
The rhymes of my lines
Jerking out linking my lines like the codes of this thin
The codes of this thing
