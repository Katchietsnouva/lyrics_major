Hello! We are glad to share with you that CloudFactory is hiring in Kenya, Nepal, and the Philippines!

We are looking for current residents of these countries for an upcoming, 100% work-from-home project. This is a great opportunity if you are interested in #3Dgames or #draftinganddesign. If you also have experience using #AutoCAD, this is for you!

Description:

The objective of the project is to analyze actual roof images (in 3-D) for residential and commercial properties with the end goal of creating a model for the roofs. These models are used for different purposes such as actual dimensions of the roof required for repair (e.g. after a hurricane) or for regular renovations. This will be based on a unique set of instructions for each property type and the models are submitted within a given deadline.

Hello. My name is Philip Katiechi, a Mechatronics student currently in my 5th year of study. I applied for the CloudFactory, experience in 3-D imagery and annotation, drafting and design, AutoCAD, or similar interests but I did not get an email yet I met the hardware threshold ( I have a core i5 with 12 Gb RAM and high speed ethernet internet)
Additionally I have worked with C# in Unity, creating 2D and 3D games. I am currently working on VR and AR in unity. I have also had a huge share in the 3D world using Blender (Python language) I am sure you’ll find my credentials in order discuss my qualifications. Please do not hesitate to contact me at your convenience (+254759 924 037). Thank you for your time and I look forward to some reply from you.Sincerely,Aswa Philip Katiechi
