vocal mixing chain look like?🤔

Here is a basic chain you can use:

🔷 Tuning
Start with using a pitch correction plugin if needed.

🔷 Corrective EQ
Use corrective EQ to get rid of unwanted frequencies like low-end rumble.

🔷 Compression
Use compression to smooth out the dynamics of the vocal.

🔷 De-Esser
Use a De-Esser to get rid of sibilance & make the vocal sound less harsh

🔷 Tone shaping EQ
Next use an EQ to shape the overall tonality of the vocal.

🔷 Reverb & Delay
At last at reverb & delay to give your vocal a lush sense of space & life.

My friends, please note that there are no hard rules for the order of the processors in your vocal chain & this is just one way of mixing your vocals.
