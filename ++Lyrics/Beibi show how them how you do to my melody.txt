Beibi, you're pretty, like my melody,
Motivate my symphony

Beibi you beauriful like the tender breeze
show them how you do to my melody

In your arms, I find my serenity.
Together we'll write our love's melo-dy.

Hand in hand, we'll chase the setting sun-ny,
In your eyes, I see my only one-ny.



You're my pretty star, shining bright in the midnight-sky,
With you, my heart can truly fly high.

In your embrace, I feel so warm and co-sy,
You're my forever, my one and only.

In the morning light, our love starts ane-wy,
Underneath the stars, we dance so free-ly.

In every word you speak, a touch of poe-try,
With you, my heart finds its home and sanctua-ry.

CHORUS

Pretty girl




Through the ups and downs, we'll never sa-ny,
In your love, I've found my every jour-ny.

Your smile brightens my day, oh so sun-ny,
In your laughter, my worries are un-done-y.

Hand in hand, we'll face life's uncertai-ny,
Together we'll conquer, strong and bra-ve-ny.

In your eyes, I see a love so prett-y,
You make my world complete and whol-y.



You're my joy, my laughter, my fantast-ny,
With you, every day feels like a grand festi-val-ny.

In the rain, we'll dance, soaked but hap-py,
You're my muse, my inspiration, my ever-ver-ny.

In your heart, I've found my destined desti-ny,
With you, I've learned what true love can tru-ly.

In your arms, I feel so warm and com-fy,
You're the one I'll cherish eterni-ty.

So let's keep writing our love sto-ry,
You and me, in perfect harmo-ny.
