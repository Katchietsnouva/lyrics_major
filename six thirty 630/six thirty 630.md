Move like you're in the heat

**Verse 1**:
In the club, we don't play
DJ spinning all night, we slay
Every move, every sway
Dancehall vibes, make 'em stay

**Verse 2**:
Bright lights, city nights
Feel the rhythm, hold it tight
Every step, pure delight
In the dance, we ignite

**Bridge**:
Six thirty, let's get flirty
Dance floor, gettin' dirty
Vibe strong, never blurry
Dancehall king, so worthy

Party till the morning light
